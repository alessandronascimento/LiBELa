### LIBELA - Ligand Binding Energy Landscape ###

LiBELa is an acronim for Ligand Binding Energy Landscape. It was originally designed to sample the Binding Energy of a ligand whithin a protein binding pocket. During the time the program was largelly modified to become a framework dedicate to two major purposes:

- [x] [Ligand- and Receptor-Based Ligand Docking](Docking.md)

and 

- [x] [Monte Carlo sampling of ligand conformations in a protein binding site](MonteCarlo.md).
