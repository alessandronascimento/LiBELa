In order to compile LiBELa, a "install" script is provided. This script is a very simple bash script
with a list of commands necessary to compile libraries and LiBELa itself.

In most scenarios, a "./install" will be enough to have LiBELa compiled. However, adjustments can be
made to the script to fit especifical needs.


INTEL COMPILER

Libela can be compiled using intel compilers. In order to compile it using icpc, set the variable CXX in 
the install script to "icpc".
